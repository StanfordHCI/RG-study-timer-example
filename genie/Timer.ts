// you need to implement the logic behind the timer

// TODO: - `Timer`: This class represents a timer. It has several properties and methods.

// implement the following properties

// TODO: - `id`: This property is a unique identifier for the timer.

// TODO: - `name`: This property is the name of the timer.

// TODO: - `type`: This property is the type of the timer.

// TODO: - `delta`: This property is the time left for the timer.

// TODO: - `created`: This property is a boolean value indicating whether the timer is created.

// TODO: - `pause`: This property is a boolean value indicating whether the timer is counting down.

// implement the following methods

// TODO: - `constructor`: This method initializes an instance of the Timer class, with default values for several properties.

// TODO: - `setup`: This method creates several default timer objects

// TODO: - `CreateTimer`: This static method creates a new timer with a given name, type and duration. The created timer is added to an internal list of timers. If no duration is given, the timer is initialized but not started.

// TODO: - `deleteTimer`: This method is used to delete an existing timer.

// TODO: - `pauseTimer`: This method is used to stop the countdown for a timer.

// TODO: - `startTimer`: This method is used to start the countdown for a timer.

// TODO: - `isFinished`: This method checks if the timer has finished counting down. 
//          You can get the left seconds of TimeDelta through getLeftSecond().

// TODO: - `countDown`: This method decreases the remaining time on the timer by one second, if the timer isn't paused.
//          You can change the value of TimeDelta through addOffset().

// add interaction examples of timers

// TODO: - `Examples`: This array contains several examples of timers.
